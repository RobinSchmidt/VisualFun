Visual Fun
----------

Some just-for-fun JavaScript code for creating visual art based on the p5.js library, which is a JavaScript version of the Processing language.

...this repo is currently a messy playground for me to learn and experiment with javascript and its libraries. It's not meant for public consumption...not yet, at least...i hope that over time some sort of library for mathematical and artistic visualization will emerge. To this end, i want port some of my C++ math- and signal processing code to JS.
