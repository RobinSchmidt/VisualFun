import/export:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import
https://javascript.info/import-export

Before declaration of a class/function/...:
  export [default] class/function/variable ...
  
Standalone export:
  export {x [as y], ...}
  
Re-export:
  export {x [as y], ...} from "module"
  export * from "module" (doesnâ€™t re-export default).
  export {default [as y]} from "module" (re-export default).
  Import:

Named exports from module:
  import {x [as y], ...} from "module"

Default export:
  import x from "module"
  import {default as x} from "module"

Everything:
  import * as obj from "module"
  Import the module (its code runs), but do not assign it to a variable:
  import "module"
  
  
// maybe use this syntax for classes - it's nicer and closer to c++:
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes
// on the other hand, using this class-based syntax may obscure the fact that in JS there actually
// are no classes - inheritance in JS is based on prototypes and it's probably a good idea to use
// a syntax that reflects that - anything else may be misleading.
