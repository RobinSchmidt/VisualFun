make a couple of small(ish) js libraries with clearly defined and limited scope:

rsCore: basic infractructure stuff like deep-copies, data-handling

rsDom: DOM traversal and manipulation convenience functions - but maybe use jquery

rsUserInterface: convenience functions for user interfaces

rsGeometry: stuff for geometric transformations for graphics:
  -classes: rsVector2D, rsMatrix2D, rsVector3D, rsMatrix3D, rsConicSection, rsProjection, 
   rsBezierCurve, rsPolygon, rsMoebiusTransform

rsLinearAlgebra: linear algebra in arbitrary dimensions - solving linear systems for dense and
  tridiagonal matrices, maybe pentadiagonals too
  
rsInterpolation: various methods fo interpolating datasets including natrual and hermite splines, 
  bilinear, bicubic, ...
  
rsNumericCalculus: numerical differentiaiton and integration routines (trapezoidal, simpson, etc.)

rsDifferentialEquations: ODE and PDE solvers

rsSignalFilters: DSP filters

rsSignalTransforms: FFT, DCT, Wavelets, etc.



maybe there should be a global object rs and various parts of the library add member functions
to it when they are imported, so when we import rsLinearAlgebra, we could call:

x = rs.solveLinearSystem(A, b);

d3 does it also like that - functions are called like d3.doStuff - doesn't pollute the global
namespace

if possible, make the dependencies clear by importing - for example - rsLinearAlgebra from 
rsInterpolation

WebPlotter
-provide 2D and 3D function and data plotting facilities, maybe even facilities to plot solutions
 of differential equations by numericall solving them (vector-fields, field lines)
