/** Plotting functions based on grafica which is a mathematical function plotting library based on 
p5.js.

Dependencies:
-grafica.js
  -p5.js    */

// ToDo: make a "class" rsPlotter with an interface similar to GNUPlotCPP - later, we may 
// implement other plotting classes with the same interface but maybe not based on grafica - then
// we can easily switch between different implementations of the plotting functionality
